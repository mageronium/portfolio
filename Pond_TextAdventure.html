                          The text adventure project is an introductory level 
                          project to python and command line coding. The main 
                          challenge of the project concerns the fact that loops 
                          were forbidden to be used in the code and for the 
                          project, which was corrected through the use of lists 
                          as most recent variables. The deliverables for this 
                          project included brainstorming and sprint tasks, 
                          conclusion questions, a gallery walk table complete 
                          with pro and con comments, fully commented code, and 
                          finally a working version of the text adventure 
                          itself. Originally the theme of the adventure was 
                          either a wild west adventure (based on an escape from 
                          a prison cell that was later adapted into a hangman 
                          game project), sci fi adventure (based on direction 
                          oriented puzzle solving and ethical conundrums), and 
                          finally a comical text adventure based on the night 
                          before finals, based almost solely on ethical 
                          conundrums and their various consequences. Following 
                          the original stages of the project where we as a 
                          group chose ‘Romancing Our Way to a 5.0’ as the theme
                          of 
                          the game, coding at the very beginning was very 
                          linear and simple prior to the discovery that index 0 
                          of a list can be used as a most recent global 
                          variable (accessed via as list[0]), which progressed 
                          into the second tier of coding where the actions and 
                          names of the user were saved across versions of the 
                          game. In this project I was responsible for most of 
                          the aforementioned coding and for laying out the 
                          skeleton of how various questions and scenarios would 
                          be presented to the viewer which required complete 
                          and organized communication with my team members. 
                          Often over the course of the project due to the 
                          intense mass of coding in a small time frame, for 
                          several days in both my free period (Gael) and lunch 
                          I worked on the project without breaks. Thereupon, 
                          this project demonstrates my ability to persevere, 
                          communicate, and, primarily,  think creatively in 
                          extremely limited situations.
