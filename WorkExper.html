                        The majority of my work experience has taught and 
                        motivated me to be a respectful, cooperative coworker.
                        Mrs. Sharbach, my eighth grade teacher (2015-2016), 
                        taught me and my classmates to fair, respectful people.
                        While Mrs. Sharbach was, officially, my English and 
                        History teacher, she was our collective mentor; she 
                        pushed us to become better people, chastised us when 
                        we were rude, and helped us grow academically. She told
                        us what she thought, why she thought it, and never 
                        looked at us as 'just students'. At times, honestly,
                        she did push us too hard but always made sure we were
                        learning and growing as both students and human beings.
                        Mrs. Sharbach is the epitome of an amazing teacher. She
                        encouraged us to give back to our community to anyone 
                        and everyone. She forced us to work with people we 
                        wouldn't typically work with so we would learn to work
                        with anyone and everyone. She made all of us more 
                        flexible, cooperative and respectful people and I can 
                        honestly say I would be a complete failure at all three
                        had I not been in her class. As she liked to say she 
                        had always taught us to be good people', and I know that
                        today I am both a better person and a better worker 
                        because of her. <br>
                        <br> In 2017, I, along with other students from Dublin High,
                        visited and were shown around the SAP campus in San 
                        Ramon. Once there we were divided into 2 groups 
                        (one would hear a lecture and the other would be 
                        shown around). The first lecture concerned the 
                        achievement of success and the second pertained 
                        to emotional intelligence, or rather concern for 
                        one's coworkers. To me, the lecture on emotional 
                        intelligence was particularly important as the ability
                        to respect one's coworkers is an essential but underesti
                        mated skill. After this, we were shown around campus and
                        what struck me most was how absolutely beautiful the 
                        campus was and, to me it seemed, how little menial labor
                        was being performed even in the workplace areas. It also
                        struck me how employees were allowed to draw on the 
                        walls as a means of communication or play. Overall, 
                        the campus appeared to be a collection of tranquil, 
                        intelligent people who completely lacked workplace
                        stress. This, from my perspective, seemed to be a 
                        result of the employees' cooperative and organized 
                        behavior. What I learnt on this field trip was that 
                        work doesn't have to be laborious as long as one is 
                        willing to cooperate and respect one's coworkers to 
                        get work done. To reiterate, from these experiences I 
                        have learnt to be respectful, cooperative worker.<br>
