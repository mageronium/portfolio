                      The Entrepreneurship Project is a project assigned yearly to all engineering 
                      students. It concerns the development of a new solution to solve a widely 
                      experienced problem. Depending on the problem, the deliverables for this 
                      project could range from a working prototype to a well developed idea for one.
                      My team (team Wake up, Breakfast Robot!) choose to address oversleeping and 
                      therefore skipping breakfast or consuming a substandard breakfast. We chose to
                      solve this problem by building and programming a prototype that makes cereal, 
                      brings it to the user, wakes the user, and gives them cereal. For this project
                      I was a primary builder. I built the platform, attached the grabbing mechanism, 
                      made and attached the multi directional wheels, and assisted in the build of 
                      the poking mechanism. I organized the build and came in almost everyday during
                      lunch or Gael to work on the robot. During this project I showed great leadership
                      and perseverance as a primary builder for the project. <br><br>

                     <h5 class="text-center">(Project 1.2.5, Started- October 16, 2017 Completed- October 20, 2017, POE period 7)</h5>
                     For the 1.2.5 project, or ' Winch Project ', my teammates and I were to build
                     a prototype for a large scale winch that was to be used by  local construction
                     company. We were asked to build a winch using a Fisher Tech motor capable of 
                     lifting a weight of at least 100 grams, 30 centimeters upward. We were limited
                     to materials found in the classroom and or approved by the teacher. For this 
                     project, I was responsible for the building and maintenance of the winch, 
                     meaning that I was the one responsible for the winch's ability to pull the 
                     weight upward. The first day was spent building the winch's skeleton and the 
                     rest of the time was spent improving the winch. During the course of this 
                     project, I came in everyday during Gael period to improve and modify the 
                     mechanism. This required me to test multiple configurations of the winch and 
                     fixing the winch when the mechanism failed. Although I was not the primary 
                     builder or developer, I was persistent and unyielding in the optimization of 
                     the winch. <br><br>
