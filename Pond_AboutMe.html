                    <p> 
                        I am currently a Junior at Dublin High School. I am taking
                        an advanced math course (Trigonometry With Pre-Calcul
                        us) and advanced life science (Honors Anatomy) course al
                        ong with an engineering course (Computer Science Princip
                        les). As a Freshman I took a graphic design course (2-D 
                        Drawing and Design) that went over the basics of visual 
                        aesthetics and patterns, before being recruited into the
                        Engineering Academy in my Sophmore year. Despite being an
                        academy student, I have very little engineering experience.
                        However, over the years, I have been taught to persevere
                        and learn how to do things along the way - by my 
                        family, teachers, and fellow students, therefore giving 
                        me the tools to overcome new and exciting challenges.  I
                        am able to persevere, encourage and cooperate with other
                        s, contribute ideas, and write reports or documents. 
                        Despite having few engineering experiences, I believe I 
                        have been particularly useful on a POE project (1.3.2) w
                        here we were asked to build a prototype of a car. Althou
                        gh I did not create the original design or lead the team
                        , I fixed an infuriating problem (friction caused by lea
                        ding sprocket pushing chain against platform) with the g
                        ear and sprocket system that powered the wheels to a pro
                        totype of a car. This allowed me and my team to move for
                        ward in fixing the motor and finding new ways to install
                        the cells to the platform of the car. It also allowed th
                        e gears to turn and therefore the wheels to move. 
                        In the future, I would like be a video game programmer a
                        nd or webpage designer seeing as I find both graphic de
                        sign and computer programming particularly interesting.
                        Although my future prospects are completely unrelated to
                        mechanical engineering, it combines two interests of min
                        e that are relatively impossible to combine otherwise.
