                    <p> 
                        I am currently a Junior at Dublin High School. I am taking
                        an advanced math course (Trigonometry With Pre-Calculus)
                        and advanced life science (Honors Anatomy) course along
                        with an engineering course (Computer Science Principles.
                        As a Freshman I took a graphic design course (2-D 
                        Drawing and Design) that went over the basics of visual 
                        aesthetics and patterns, before being recruited into the
                        Engineering Academy in my Sophmore year. Despite having 
                        been an
                        academy student, I have very little engineering experience.
                        However, over the years, I have been taught to persevere
                        and learn how to do things along the way - by my 
                        family, teachers, and fellow students, therefore giving 
                        me the tools to overcome new and exciting challenges.  I
                        am able to persevere, encourage and cooperate with others,
                         contribute ideas, and write reports or documents. 
                        Despite having few engineering experiences, I believe I 
                        have been particularly useful on a POE project (1.3.2) where
                        we were asked to build a prototype of a car. Although
                        I did not create the original design or lead the team,
                         I fixed an infuriating problem (friction caused by 
                        leading sprocket pushing chain against platform) with the 
                        gear and sprocket system that powered the wheels to a
                        prototype of a car. This allowed me and my team to move for
                        ward in fixing the motor and finding new ways to install
                        the cells to the platform of the car. It also allowed
                        the gears to turn and therefore the wheels to move. 
                        In the future, I would like be a video game programmer
                        and or webpage designer seeing as I find both graphic 
                        design and computer programming particularly interesting.
                        Although my future prospects are completely unrelated to
                        mechanical engineering, it combines two interests of
                        mine that are relatively impossible to combine 
                        otherwise.
