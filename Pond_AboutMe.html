                            I am currently a Junior at Dublin High School. I am
                            taking an advanced math course (Trigonometry With 
                            Pre-Calculus) and advanced life science (Honors
                            Anatomy)
                            course along with an engineering course (Computer 
                            Science Principles). As a Freshman I took a graphic 
                            design course (2-D Drawing and Design) that went
                            over the basics of visual
                            aesthetics and patterns, before being recruited into 
                            the Engineering Academy in my Sophmore year. Despite 
                            being an academy student, I have very little
                            engineering experience. However, over the years, I
                            have been taught to
                            persevere and learn how to do things along the way
                            - by my family, teachers, and fellow students,
                            therefore
                            giving me the tools to overcome new and exciting 
                            challenges. I am able to persevere, encourage and 
                            cooperate with others, contribute ideas, and write 
                            reports or documents.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Despite having few engineering experiences, I
                            believe I 
                            have been particularly useful on a POE project
                            (1.3.2) 
                            where we were asked to build a prototype of a car. 
                            Although I did not create the original design or
                            lead 
                            the team, I fixed an infuriating problem (friction 
                            caused by leading sprocket pushing chain against 
                            platform) with the gear and sprocket system that
                            powered
                            the wheels to a prototype of a car. This allowed me
                            and my team to move forward in fixing the motor and
                            finding 
                            new ways to install the cells to the platform of the
                            car.
                            It also allowed the gears to turn and therefore the 
                            wheels to move. In the future, I would like be a
                            video 
                            game programmer and or webpage designer seeing as I
                            find both graphic design and computer programming 
                            particularly interesting.
                            Although my future prospects are completely
                            unrelated
                            to mechanical engineering, it combines two interests
                            of 
                            mine that are relatively impossible to combine
                            otherwise.
