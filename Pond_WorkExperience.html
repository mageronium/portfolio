                            The majority of my work experience has taught and 
                            motivated me to be a respectful, cooperative
                            coworker.
                            Mrs. Sharbach, my eighth grade teacher (2015-2016), 
                            taught me and my classmates to fair, respectful
                            people.
                            While Mrs. Sharbach was, officially, my English and 
                            History teacher, she was our collective mentor; she 
                            pushed us to become better people, chastised us when 
                            we were rude, and helped us grow academically. She
                            told
                            us what she thought, why she thought it, and never 
                            looked at us as 'just students'. At times, honestly,
                            she did push us too hard but always made sure we
                            were
                            learning and growing as both students and human
                            beings.
                            Mrs. Sharbach is the epitome of an amazing teacher.
                            She
                            encouraged us to give back to our community to
                            anyone 
                            and everyone. She forced us to work with people we 
                            wouldn't typically work with so we would learn to
                            work
                            with anyone and everyone. She made all of us more 
                            flexible, cooperative and respectful people and I
                            can honestly say I would be a complete failure at
                            all three
                            had I not been in her class. As she liked to say she 
                            had always taught us to be good people', and I know
                            that
                            today I am both a better person and a better worker 
                            because of her.

                            In 2017, I, along with other students from Dublin
                            High,
                            visited and were shown around the SAP campus in San 
                            Ramon. Once there we were divided into 2 groups 
                            (one would hear a lecture and the other would be 
                            shown around). The first lecture concerned the 
                            achievement of success and the second pertained 
                            to emotional intelligence, or rather concern for 
                            one's coworkers. To me, the lecture on emotional 
                            intelligence was particularly important as the ability
                            to respect one's coworkers is an essential but 
                            underestimated skill. After this, we were shown
                            around 
                            campus and what struck me most was how absolutely 
                            beautiful the campus was and, to me it seemed, how 
                            little menial labor
                            was being performed even in the workplace areas. It
                            also
                            struck me how employees were allowed to draw on the 
                            walls as a means of communication or play. Overall, 
                            the campus appeared to be a collection of tranquil, 
                            intelligent people who completely lacked workplace
                            stress. This, from my perspective, seemed to be a 
                            result of the employees' cooperative and organized 
                            behavior. What I learnt on this field trip was that 
                            work doesn't have to be laborious as long as one is 
                            willing to cooperate and respect one's coworkers to 
                            get work done. To reiterate, from these experiences
                            I 
                            have learnt to be respectful, cooperative worker.

                            From my volunteer experience that concerns, 
                            primarily, interacting with children I have 
                            bettered my patience and communicative skills. I 
                            started volunteering at Crosspoint Church in 
                            November of 2018. From my volunteer work, I can 
                            confidently say that I would make cooperative and 
                            well-organized employee capable even of assuming 
                            leadership roles when necessary, as seen in my 
                            recent employment at CGA, California Gymnastics 
                            Academy, as a Kinder and Introductory level coach 
                            where I have extrapolated and applied the 
                            aforementioned skills.
